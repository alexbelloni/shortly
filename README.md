## About
The original idea was downloaded on frontendmentor website as a design guide.  
Shortly was created using vanilla JavaScript.  
The "Shorten it" click transforms a long URL into a short one by using Bitly or Rebrandly tools, radically.  
When clicking on the SignUp button, it calls Authorization Firebase API with the Google option. The return is a valid user, which name is printed on the page. This function could be used to save a short URL on the database. 

## New knowledge
Netlify functions for getting environment variables
